# Welcome to my repository for "Code + Words Studio" in 2020 at RMIT University for 13 weeks periods. This course is lecture by the lovely couple : Karen Ann Donnachie & Andy Simionato.

# This studio is about the interdependent and complex ecosystems made up of "code" and "words".Throughout the studio we learnt how to 're-read' critical texts on language and reading through the creative use of computer code and scripting. We expanded our existing design practice by combining computer scripting (code) with typography (words) in order to explore how reading is transforming in the digital age.

# Here is what we were doing in our studio from week 01-13. Please have fun and enjoy our code-learning via virtual world during COVID-19.
