# Welcome to "Code + Words Studio", 2020 @ RMIT University 

This Code + Words Studio is for the interdependent and complex ecosystems made up of "code" and "words".Throughout the studio we learnt how to 're-read' critical texts on language and reading through the creative use of computer code and scripting. We expanded our existing design practice by combining computer scripting (code) with typography (words) in order to explore how reading is transforming in the digital age.

The studio was lectured by the lovely couple : Karen Ann Donnachie & Andy Simionato.

## Student Knowledge Object :

This studio invole three main assignments. 

The first assignment is "Student Knowledge Object", this task is present through this Github wiki-page with links to an external sites provides. The purose of this task is pretty much like an online-diary othat we use to documents everthing that we learnt in the duration of the course.

The second aassignment is called " Re-reading", in this task we have to explore how reading is changing in virtual environments. The reading that we were assigned to work with on called “The House Of Leaves”. This book is a debut novel by American author Mark Z. Danielewski, published in March 2000 by Pantheon Books. The chapter that my group chosen to work on is the “Introduction Part” of this book. We chosen to use Minecraft as our digital space to show “how this reading is changing in virtual environments”.

The last assignment is a called "Codewords major project". This assessment task we will research, develop, code and publish a digital version of a critical text on art and language. Our final deliverable for this task is a website (github) URL of your published project, but there are some steps (milestones) along the way which you need to complete before you can deliver your project. This assessment task is made up of four distinct milestones. At each stage you will be provided with an ongoing assessment and feedback. This process is intended to provide us with the most opportunities to develop a complex and rich project outcome. For this project, I created the game called “Glitchspeak” - logic game for reading.  This game is designed based on the text “Creating the “Perfect Glitch” using critical media aesthetic”, from the book called “The Glitch Moment (Um)” by Rosa Menkman. The chosen text describes what it is mean by “Glitchspeak”. This chapter illustrate the meanings of contructed and destructed glitch, also how it generates new meaning and expression. I have chosen to work with this text because I love the theory in which when glitch ruins, it generates new possibilities and new meaning arise.

## Reflection :

What I would love to say as a starting point is " HELLO WORLD". Honestly, code languages via Processing is very new to me. What describe the feeling of learning code is, while no success, try agian, if dead, break. I was having a good-times and bad-times learning codes. I am very thankful that this studio was lectured by the lovely couple : Karen Ann Donnachie & Andy Simionato. They were very supportive and helping me to get throught the difficulties-times, challenges and given the best advise for a creative ways of coding. Apart from coding, I also enjoy learning others things through virtual world. For example, algorithmic typography, virtual ddentities, understanding the contents, research , creating a concept, getting feedbacks, design collaboration, protype-making and production tools/resources toward the final design outcome. Personally, I feel that after taking this studio, there are so many things for me to explore in Code World. In the current digital age, I feel that coding play a significant part in our world via websites, applications, games and even in the exhibition. I would love to apply this knowledges from this course into my future project when I am creating my own brand. I would to apply code knowledge in branding identity and brand language with some visual movement, animations, motions and interaction. I my perspective, I feel that coding helps to enhance the users; interactions and experiences in such a concemporary ways.
